of your project "Chrome Killer" in the requested format:

1. **Project Name:** Chrome Killer
2. **Short Description:** A Python script designed to close all running instances of Chrome and its associated chromedriver process.
3. **Overall Description:** The Chrome Killer project utilizes the psutil library to iterate through all system processes, identifying and terminating any instance of chrome.exe or chromedriver.exe. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple versions of Chrome are being run simultaneously, causing conflicts or consuming excessive system resources. By automatically closing these processes, Chrome Killer aims to streamline browser management and improve overall system performance.
4. **Main Purpose:** The primary purpose of this project is to provide an automated solution for managing Chrome instances on a system, freeing up resources and reducing potential conflicts.
5. **Key Technologies:**
   - psutil
6. **Unique Features:**
   - Automatic process termination based on specific executable names (chrome.exe and chromedriver.exe)
7. **Future Improvements:**
   - Implementing filtering options to exclude certain processes from being terminated (e.g., instances running in a specific folder or with a particular user context)
   - Enhancing the script's error handling capabilities to ensure smoother operation in diverse system environments
8. **Personal Notes:** This project serves as an opportunity to experiment with process management and automation using Python.
9. **GitHub Tags:** automation,python,process-management,chrome-killer
10. **Installable Modules:** psutil
11. **Suggested Folder Names:** chrome, processes, auto_close
12. **Root Project Folder Name Suggestions:** chrome_terminator, process_manager, browser_killer
