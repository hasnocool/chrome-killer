Here's the summary of my project:

**1. Project Name:** Chrome Killer
**2. Short Description:** A Python script that automatically kills chromedriver and chrome.exe processes on your system to free up resources and improve overall system performance.
**3. Overall Description:** I built this script using the psutil library in Python, which allows it to efficiently scan for and terminate unnecessary chromedriver and chrome.exe processes. With Chrome Killer, you can easily clear out any lingering browser processes that are hogging CPU or memory resources, making your computer feel snappier and more responsive.
**4. Main Purpose:** My primary motivation behind creating Chrome Killer was to provide a simple solution for users who experience performance issues due to excessive chromedriver and chrome.exe usage. By automating the process of killing these unnecessary processes, I aimed to create a tool that can help alleviate system slowdowns and make it easier for people to enjoy faster computing experiences.
**5. Key Technologies:**
   - **Python 3.x**: The programming language used to write the script.
   - **psutil**: A cross-platform library that provides an interface for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization metrics.
**6. Unique Features:**
   - **Process Identification:** Chrome Killer utilizes the psutil library to identify specific chromedriver and chrome.exe processes based on their names, ensuring accurate targeting of unnecessary processes.
   - **Automated Process Termination:** The script takes care of terminating identified processes, freeing up system resources and improving overall performance.
**7. Future Improvements:**
   - **Process Monitoring:** I'm thinking about adding a feature that allows the script to monitor system processes in real-time, enabling it to automatically terminate unnecessary chromedriver and chrome.exe processes as they appear.
   - **Customization Options:** Another potential improvement would be to incorporate user-configurable parameters, such as specifying which types of processes to target or setting thresholds for CPU and memory usage.
**8. Personal Notes:** I'm really proud of how Chrome Killer turned out! It was a fun project that allowed me to experiment with Python and the psutil library. If you're experiencing performance issues due to chromedriver and chrome.exe, give it a try – your system (and your patience) will thank you!
